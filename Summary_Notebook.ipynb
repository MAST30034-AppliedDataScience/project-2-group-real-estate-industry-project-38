    "In both Pearson and Spearman correlation analysis, the main internal factors influencing rental price are  the number of bathrooms (bath_info) and the number of bedrooms (bed_info). These features are directly related to the comfort and functionality of a house, thus having a significant impact on rental costs.Additionally, the crime rate (avg_crime_count) shows the highest negative correlation with rental prices, indicating that a higher crime rate may lower rental levels in the area. Overall Pearson or Spearman correlations remain consistent for most features. However, land area has a significant higher value in Spearman analysis, which may be hint at a non-linear relationship between land area and rental price.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **External Features:**\n",
    "In comparison, external features have lower overall correlation values with rental prices. The main external factors influencing rental prices are features related to the proximity to major universities. Areas near these universities typically have higher demand, leading to increased rental costs. Additionally, the number of primary and secondary schools within a 3000-meter radius and the distance to hospitals also significantly impact rental prices, reflecting the importance of educational resources and medical facilities.  Notably, in the Spearman correlation analysis, features related to the number of public facilities near the property shifted from negative to positive correlations and became more significant. This may be due to a non-linear relationship between the number of public facilities and rental prices."

    "  - The objective is to forecast rental prices from **2024 to 2027** and analyze the growth trends for the next three years.\n",
    "  - **Region Classification**: Time series models use **LGA (Local Government Area)** shapefiles to categorize the regions, providing a more aggregated view of the region classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Assumption & Limitation:** Assuming that the quarterly rental price trends predicted by the time series models are independent of external factors. This is primarily due to the lack of quarterly segmented external datasets, such as income and employment data.\n",

    " **Model Types**:\n",
    "  1. **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**:\n",
    "     - SARIMA extends the standard ARIMA model by accounting for seasonal patterns in the data, making it suitable for time series with both trend and seasonal components.\n",
    "     - The model uses additional seasonal parameters to capture recurring patterns in the data, making it ideal for time series with stable seasonal trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. **Prophet**:\n",

    "     - It is particularly effective for handling sudden changes in data trends and can incorporate external variables, such as holidays and events.\n",

    "  | **Prophet** | - Easy to use, with automatic parameter optimization.<br>- Handles complex trends and multiple seasonal components.<br>- Supports external variables (holidays, trend shifts).<br>- Robust to missing data and outliers. | - Performance is suboptimal when seasonality is weak.<br>- Limited effectiveness on small datasets. | Best suited for data with complex patterns and non-linear changes (e.g., event-driven data). |\n",
    "\n",
    " **Application Context**:\n",
    "  - For this dataset, which consists of Victoria’s quarterly rental prices from 1999 to 2024, both SARIMA and Prophet are suitable choices due to their ability to model long-term trends and seasonal components.\n",

    " **Result Comparison**:\n",
    "  - **SARIMA Predictions**: In the SARIMA forecast results, **all 66 LGAs in Victoria show an upward trend** in future rental prices.\n",
    "  - **Prophet Predictions**: The Prophet model, on the other hand, shows that **some regions**, particularly in the **Melbourne metropolitan area**, experience a slight decline. However, the decline is relatively minor, generally **less than 5%**.\n",
    "  \n",
    " **Future Growth Forecast**:\n",
    "  - Use SARIMA and Prophet to forecast median weekly rental prices for Victoria from **2024 to 2027**, and analyze the growth trends for different regions over the next three years.\n",

    "    - The **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for the linear regression model on the validation dataset is **1058**, indicating a high level of error and suggesting that the model may not fit the data well.\n",
    "  - **Random Forest Regression**:\n",
    "    - The **Random Forest Regression** model achieves a significantly lower **MSE of 546** on the same validation dataset, indicating a better fit to the current dataset and a more accurate prediction capability compared to Linear Regression.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Conclusion**:\n",
    "    - The performance comparison indicates that the **Random Forest Regression** is better suited for this dataset, as it captures the underlying patterns and complexities more effectively than Linear Regression.\n",
    "  \n",
    " **Application Context**:\n",
    "  - Linear Regression is used to model the relationship between socio-economic indicators and median housing prices, providing a clear interpretation of the factors driving housing prices.\n",
    "  - Random Forest Regression is applied when the relationship between variables is complex and non-linear, leveraging the ensemble approach to capture deeper insights.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Result Comparison**:\n",
    "  - **Linear Regression Predictions**: Provides a strong explanatory framework, but struggles with non-linear relationships.\n",
    "  - **Random Forest Predictions**: Effectively captures non-linear patterns and interactions between variables but can become overfitted if not tuned properly.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Final Decision**:\n",
    "  - In the final validation analysis, **Random Forest Regression** performed better, with lower error metrics and better predictive capability.\n",
    "  \n",
    " **Future Growth Forecast**:\n",
    "  - Use both Linear Regression and Random Forest to forecast median housing prices for the next three years, analyzing the growth trends for different regions and comparing with time series models.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Model Comparison**:\n",
    "  - When comparing all four models, **Random Forest Regression** showed better performance on validation data. Therefore, to provide a balanced forecast, the final predictions are presented as the **average of all four models (SARIMA, Prophet, Linear Regression, and Random Forest)**, providing a more robust and objective view of the projected trends.\n"
